# CS50 Homepage


## Description
Website example for week 8 of cs50. 

## HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap
Used these to try and replicate the look of cs50's course website with a sidebar and
main content. Added a top bar just for educational purposes.

## Git/Github
Running this locally to get some git/github practice
